# 2. Prototyping

### You might not need a "custom built"

1. [UX prototypes](../by-topic/ux/prototyping.md#readme) might be enough.
1. Be sure to spend some time doing some [user-experience analysis](../by-topic/ux/analysis.md#readme)


### When you start building your custom bits

1. Do you need user-accounts? [Use something like Auth0.](../by-topic/data/user-accounts.md#readme)
1. Use something like Firebase to [store your data](../by-topic/data/storage.md#readme)
1. Start [capturing as much metrics](../by-topic/metrics#readme) as much you can.
1. Consider your [data security](../by-topic/data/security.md#readme)
